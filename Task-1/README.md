  Update stock after purchase.  
  Generate receipts for purchased books.

- **Book Reviews and Ratings**:  
  Let users rate books and add reviews after purchase.

- **Advanced Features** (Optional):  
  - **Recommendation System**: Suggest books based on genre or user ratings.  
  - **Membership System**: Implement a loyalty program with additional discounts.  
  - **Visualizations**: Use Matplotlib for visualizing genre popularity and monthly sales trends.
